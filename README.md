# StellarisTechTree
This project is meant to expose the tech tree better to players. 

# Restrictions

This program only works on a Windows machine that has had Stellaris directly installed on it through Steam.
It will not work with pirated versions of the game, a version that was just copied via hard-drive and not directly installed or if it was installed through another reseller. If it is desired I can look into adding support for other resellers, but I would need some information on those for that to happen.

# Usage
In its current form the GUI is rather simple ... I may wish to expand on that in the future when time allows.

The textbox can be thought of as a search box where you enter the name of the technology you wish to explore.

Clicking on various displayed technologies will make the application look those up ... so you do not need to type them out separately.
